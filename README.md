Boris Bikes
===========
This project serves as an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the basics of Object-Oriented Design (OOD). We are creating a simple system for managing Boris (Barclays) Bikes in London. 

Day 1 
-----
Paired with Toan (@yoshdog) today TDD'ing Boris Bikes. We learned about classes, domain models and CRC (Class Responsibility Collaborators) and used them on this project. It was interesting to have to work out what responsibilities belong to certain classes and how they interact with one another. Toan and I were all over the best practices by using branches while functionality was still being developed, committing often, writing meaningful commit messages. Super fun pairing with him!

Day 2
------
Paired with Charlotte (@cmew3) today to program our Boris Bikes project from scratch. Learned about Object-Oriented doubling (London style) and mocking (Chicago style), and prepending modules.
